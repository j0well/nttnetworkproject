Starting with building the network I configured the CLI in the Fortigate Firewall 

## Network Setup 
Task: 
Build out the network infrastructure for the small business environment.
The client requested a LAN, Guest, and DMZ network.
Build these networks on a FortiNet firewall (a FortiGate).

### Configured the LAN interface using putty
